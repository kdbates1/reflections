What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a new respositoiry structor in the current directory. You need to do that to store your files for a particular project. The connits will based on the new repository data.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area stores the changes you have staged. The working directory are the files that are currenlty being worked. The value i think this adds is that it allows you to stage test files before actually committing them to the repository.
